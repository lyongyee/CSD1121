// @todo: Provide function-level documentation header as explained in Assignment 2 specs ...
// It is important that you provide function-level documentation header in
// this [header] file since this file is what you would provide to your
// clients and other users to solve problems related to conversions of
// decimal numbers to Roman numerals. In a commercial environment,
// the source file q.c containing the definition of function decimal_to_roman is
// your intellectual property and should therefore be kept private. Instead,
// you'll provide your clients the object file q.o [obtained by only compiling q.c].
// Therefore, your clients will know how to use the function decimal_to_roman
// only by reading this function-level documentation header ...
#include <stdio.h>
// @todo: Now, provide the declaration or prototype of function decimal_to_roman ...
void decimal_to_roman(int values);
